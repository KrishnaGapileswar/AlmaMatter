    		Naveen who was busy with his lab observation work asked his mate Sangu to buy him a notebook and gave Rs. 50. 
    		Sangu who is fond of Onion maggi spends Rs. 35 on it and lies to Naveen that he lost his note somewhere.
    		 But Naveen was not satisfied with Sangu's answer and took to the issue to the techno geek Tootcat.
    		 After a day Tootcat found that Sangu had eaten maggi using Naveen's money. 
    		 Sangu was baffled and asked Tootcat how he had found that.Tootcat explained his investigation to Sangu. He asked Naveen at what time he gave Sangu the money then he inquired at Gurunath (stationery store in college) if there was any transaction of buying a notebook exchanging Rs. 50 and there was none. He also knew that Sangu was a maggi freak and inquired at the maggi station and found the truth. While writing this my friend Khan asked me, “Is this possible?”. I replied, “It is possible with blockchain”. He asked me to explain that. 
    		Then we had a little conversation over that.
    	</p>
    	
    	<p>
    		Me: Instead of having a manual ledger, blockchain maintains an open distributed ledger that can be viewed by all nodes in a network. 
    	</p>
    	
    	<p>
    	Khan: What is a ledger?
    	</p>
    	
    	<p>
    	Me: A ledger is like a register where you record all the transactions. In the blockchain technology, every transaction is recorded and a key is associated with each record. When a new record is created it is chained to the previous records and the key now created depends on the previous keys. 
    	
    	</p>
    	Khan: So if anyone alters the record, the algorithm can easily detect it. Is it so?
    	<p>
    	
    	Me: Exactly.
    	</p>
    	<p>
    	Khan: Is it okay that all the records are public? How can you trust everyone?
    	</p>
    	<p>
    		Me: This is where a Miner comes in.
    	</p>
    	<p>
    	Khan: Miner. Sounds weird.
    	</p>
    	
    	<p>
    		Me: Yes. There are some special nodes in the network which will maintain the records. These special nodes are called “miners”. The miner who monitors the transactions has to validate the transaction.
    	</p>
    	<p>
    		Khan: How can the miner validate the transactions?
    	</p>
    	<p>
    	Me: In order to identify the key associated with the transaction, there is no other way except guess. If a miner validates the transaction successfully, he/she gets a reward in the form of Bitcoin. 
    	</p>
    	<p>
    	Khan: I see. How is bitcoin different from blockchain?
    	
    	</p>
    	<p>
    		Me: They are unrelated bro. Blockchain is the technology that drives bitcoin.
    	</p>
    	
    	<p>
    		Khan: I see. How can I feel the impact of blockchain in real life?
    	</p>
    	<p>
    	Me: That's a good question. Say you buy an organic apple from a store. How do you know the apple is really organic?
    	</p>
    	
    	<p style="text-align: center;">
    	(Khan looking curious)
    	</p>
    	
    	<p>
    	This is where blockchain has its role. It leads us to a world where an apple will carry a QR code and scanning the code will present all the records right from the buying of seeds to how it reached the store.
    	</p>
    	
    	<p>
    	Khan: Cool. It's interesting and I will dig deep into it.
    	</p>
